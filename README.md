### Installing the Project
- git clone https://github.com/jeffkempster/codelouisville.git 
- This project was coded in Python 3 (version 3.6.4) on a MacBook Pro with MacOS High Sierra 10.13.6
- You should only need to Install Anaconda

### I use the following tools and frameworks with this project
- Anaconda - https://www.anaconda.com/download
- Jupyter Notebook - http://jupyter.org/install
- SQLite3 - https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sqlite/sqlite_installation.htm
- Pandas - https://pandas.pydata.org/
- Matplotlib.pyplot - https://matplotlib.org/users/installing.html

### Using the Notebook
- Open your terminal
- cd (change directory) to the cloned folder
- Run Jupyter Notebook by typing jupyter notebook at the terminal prompt
- Open the file Disney Wait Times.ipynb
- From the Cell Menu choose Run All

### The Fun Part
If you are a Disney fan like me, you will want to know the burning question.  When is the best time to visit Disney World in Florida.  More specifically, when is the best time of the year, the best day of the week and the best parks to visit each day.

This project contains wait time data for 9 attractions at Walt Disney World.  The Jupyter notebook will perform the following:
- Create a sqlite database
- Create tables to load data into
- Loop over each of the 9 CSV files provided by Touring Plans and import the data
- Analyze the data import itself
- Analyze specific questions about the best time of year, time of week to visit

**Please refer to more specific information and details in the notebook**
